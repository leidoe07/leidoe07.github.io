      <p>This was my first ever project in Full-Stack Development.
        The code is a Python script that prompts the user to input various elements such as the name of a sea animal, ages, verbs, an insulting response, and more. After collecting these inputs, the script constructs a short story using the provided inputs, detailing a situation where a sea animal faces bullying from its older siblings, leading to a tragic outcome. The story is then printed out with the user's inputs integrated into it.

The game presents the player with a scenario where they wake up in a room and are given options to explore their surroundings, such as looking in a mirror or opening a closet. Depending on the choices made, the player can encounter different scenarios, including finding warm clothes, encountering a clown family, or facing game over situations like turning into a snowman or encountering a threatening entity. The player's choices determine the progression and outcome of the game, leading to either success or failure.
